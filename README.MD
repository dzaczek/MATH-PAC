# ᗧ • • • MATH-PAC

**MATH-PAC** is a 3D browser-based educational game designed to help children master numbers and counting in multiple languages. The player controls a 3D character (Pacman style), eating numbers in the correct sequence to progress.

The project is built with **Three.js** and features a YouTube API integration for a reward system.

## ✨ Key Features

* **3D Gameplay:** Full 3D board with character movement physics.
* **Educational Value:** Teaches number sequences, even/odd numbers, tens, etc.
* **Multilingual:** Supports 4 languages (English, Polish, German, French) – both text and audio (TTS).
* **Smart Reward System:** Completing a level triggers a 60-second bonus video from YouTube (e.g., cartoons).
* **"Safe Spawn" System:** Logic ensures numbers do not spawn on top of the player or overlap with each other, ensuring readability.
* **Visual Hints:** Color-coded system (Green/Red) to help identify the next target (toggleable via `H` key).

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

The game runs in a browser but **requires a local server** (due to CORS security policies and ES6 modules) and audio file generation.
### 0. FAST TRACK

```git  clone https://github.com/dzaczek/MATH-PAC
cd MATH-PAC 
python3 -m http.server
```
OPEN WEBBROWSER: localhost:8000     

### 1. Download

Clone the repository or download the files to a folder, e.g., `math-pac`.

### 2. Generate Audio (Bash Required)

The game relies on Google Text-to-Speech assets. You must run the provided script to download `.mp3` files into the `assets` folder.

In a Terminal (Linux/Mac) or Git Bash (Windows):

```bash
chmod +x getsound.sh
./getsound.sh

```

*This script downloads numbers 1-39 and error messages for all 4 languages.*

### 3. Run Local Server

**Do not** open `index.html` by double-clicking. Use one of the following methods:

* **VS Code (Recommended):** Install the "Live Server" extension, right-click `index.html`, and select "Open with Live Server".
* **Python:**
```bash
python3 -m http.server

```


* **Node.js:**
```bash
npx http-server .

```



Open your browser at the address provided (usually `http://localhost:8000` or `http://127.0.0.1:5500`).

## 🎮 Controls

* **W / Arrow Up** – Move Forward
* **S / Arrow Down** – Move Backward
* **A / Arrow Left** – Turn/Move Left
* **D / Arrow Right** – Turn/Move Right
* **H** – Toggle Hints (Turn target color highlighting On/Off)

## ⚙️ Configuration (For Parents/Teachers)

All game settings are located at the top of the `game.js` file.

### Level Editing

You can define custom levels in the `LEVEL_CONFIG` array.

```javascript
const LEVEL_CONFIG = [
    // Range Mode: Generates numbers from min to max sequentially
    { mode: 'range', min: 1, max: 10 },
    
    // List Mode: Spawns specific numbers in the defined order
    { mode: 'list', numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] } 
];

```

### Bonus Video Editing

To change the cartoons played after completing a level, edit the `BONUS_PLAYLIST` array in `game.js`. Paste the **YouTube Video ID** (the part after `v=` in the URL).

```javascript
const BONUS_PLAYLIST = [
    "wzb0uolNv5c", // Video ID for Level 1 reward
    "dQw4w9WgXcQ", // Video ID for Level 2 reward
];

```

## 🛠 Technologies Used

* **HTML5 / CSS3**
* **JavaScript (ES6 Modules)**
* **Three.js** (3D Graphics Rendering)
* **YouTube IFrame Player API** (Video handling)
* **Google Translate TTS** (Audio generation)

## ⚠️ Known Issues / Troubleshooting

1. **No Sound:** Modern browsers block auto-playing audio. You must interact with the page (click the language button in the menu) for audio to work.
2. **CORS Error (Access to script blocked):** If you see this error in the console, you are likely opening the file directly from the disk. Please follow the **Run Local Server** step in the Installation section.
